All the solutions can be found in the lw222gz folder. The motivation for my time complexity solutions can be found in a .txt
also in the lw222gz folder. On the methods that execute the algorithms for the time complexity assignment comments can be found
with time complexity for different actions, some of these have sources showing the time complexity for that action.

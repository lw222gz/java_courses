--ASSIGNMENT 3 DFS and BFS--
O(N + E) Where N is the amount amount of nodes and E is the amount of edges
Motivation: the loop length is determined by the amount of nodes that can be reached from the root node.
The loop will only visit a node once and never cross the same edge more than once.


--ASSIGNMENT 3 Transitive Closure--
O(N^2+N*E) Where N is the amount of nodes and E is the amount of edges
Motivation: Since a DFS search is being made on each node (which takes O(N+E) time) we can draw the conclusion
of N * (N+E) which can be shortened down to O(N^2 + N*E)

--ASSIGNMENT 3 Connected Components--
O((N^2+N*E) + N) where N is the amount of Nodes and E is the amount of edges
Motivation:
